        <!-- what i hope to get out of this class -->
        I am super excited for this class! Coming out of Python-Django, I feel prepared and excited to learn a new framework. Devloping these
        crucial skills is essential to survive in the business world and I know that Professor Hilton will help us succeed both in
        and out of class. I have enjoyed his classes so far throughout my college education and know that I will continue to do so.
